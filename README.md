## **Tutorial 1 - Tableau Software**
Friday 12/01/2018 15:45-17:45

*Tableau Tutorial* 

1. The goal is to have a first experience with Tableau and build standard charts using a simple dataset.
2. Download and install [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/) (Free) on your machine
3. (Simple) alternative to Tableau: [Polestar](http://vega.github.io/polestar/)

*Iris flowers visualization*

1. Download the [`iris.csv`](data/iris.csv) and load it in Tableau; convert data types (if needed)
2. Plot a **scatterplot** with X:sepal_length, Y:sepal_width, color:species and a trend line 
3. Save as a tab and save the workbook

*Elections map*

1. Download the [`us-elections-history.csv`](data/us-elections-history.csv)` and load it in Tableau; convert data types (if needed)
2. Plot a grid plot with `Year` as columns, `State` as rows and `State Winner` as color/marks.
3. Save as a tab
4. Plot a **geo-map** with colors winning party in 2012 `Latitude (generated)` et `Longitude (generated)`, with `State` as shapes and color `ATTR([State Winner])`
5. Save as a tab and save the workbook

*Stock markets visualizations*

1. Download the [`stocks.csv`](data/stocks.csv) and load it in Tableau; convert data types (if needed)
2. Plot a **multiple line chart** over time, for all stocks in a different color, grouped by company
3. Plot a **grouped bar chart** (companies as categories, grouped by year or by companies)
4. **Your own chart**!
5. Save as a tab and save the workbook

*Bonus*

* For each previous dataset, provide an alternative visualization.
* Find a more complex stock dataset with OHLC attributes (Open, High, Low, Close) and visualize intra-day variations
* Find more time points and companies and re-produce the previous charts; adapt accordingly.
* Use other markets data (e.g. BitCoin)
* Use other tools, e.g. Vega Lite to visualize the above or your dataset

ðŸ“… **For next class (19/01)**

Assignments

* Submit your Tableau workbook
* Propose a project topic (2-page): what is the question you want to answer? which data do you need? how do you plan to collect your data? what are the main risk in collecting/visualizing it? what are the privacy/ethical issues?

Readings

* [Chapter 1. Introduction
